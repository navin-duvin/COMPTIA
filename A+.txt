IDENTIFYING PURPOSE & CHARACTERISTICS OF MOTHERBOARD

Types of Motherboard

Based on Component Placement
We have two types
	INTEGRATED MOTHERBOARD
		Small
		They are used in laptops
		Size is very small
		Portable
		No wires
Disadvantage - it produces more heat, troubleshooting is tough

	NON INTEGRATED MOTHERBOARD
		Big
		They are used in desktops
		Heat produced is very less
		Troubleshooting is easy
		Size is big
		Not portable
		More no of wires

BASED ON FORM FACTOR

ATX
Advanced technology extended 
	80% of all the desktops, laptops are ATX motherboards
	Perpendicular 90 degrees

BTX
Balanced technology extended
	This is used in server rooms
	Speed is high and heat produced is high - both are maintained equally.
	Not perpendicular.

CHIPSET
	Checks with all the components functionality with input and output process
	Evolution - Electronic components -> circuit board -> integrated circuit -> chipset
	Intel manufactured motherboard - 2 chipset
	Sis - silicon integrated system motherboard - 1 chipset
	Iha - intel hub architecture - 1 chipset

PROCESSOR
	Has two components with it
	North Bridge : connect all the high speed components to the processor.(ex : RAM,AGP,PCI)
	South Bridge : connect all the slow speed components to the processor.(ex:USB,BIOS)

PROCESSOR SLOT
	LGA : Land Grid Array (old)
	PGA : Pin Grid Array (new)

EXPANSION SLOT
	Used to upgrade your computer
	Troubleshooting
Peripheral ports (backside ports)
	PCI - Peripheral Component Interconnect
	AGP - Accelerated Graphics Port 
	PCIe -PCI express : PCI + AGP

MEMORY SLOT
	RAM slot
	Old : Single Inline Memory Module (SIMM)
	Desktops : Dual Inline Memory Module (DIMM)
	Laptops : Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module (SODIMM)
	Mobile : Micro DIMM

POWER CONNECTOR
	SMPS : SWITCH MODE POWER SUPPLY
	Converts actual current to direct current and then feed its to other components
	Ex : mobile charger

ON BOARD DISK DRIVE CONNECTORS
	ON BOARD - motherboard
	DISK DRIVE - hdd, fdd, cd/dvd
	CONNECTORS - PATA & SATA
	PATA - Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment
	Old, slow, 40 pins
	SATA - Serial Advanced Technology Attachment
	New, fast, 7 pins

	F1 or F8 to start BIOS
	BOOT DEVICE PRIORITY - setting priority in which order the processor should choose os from hdd or cd/dvd or usb.

CMOS
	Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor
	Responsible for date & time and BIOS
	Failure  : date and time moving backwards, password lost or internet not connected.

JUMPER
	Used for hardware configuration
	This decides which harddisk os should be the master os.

FIRMWARE
	It is a software
	Any important software is called a firmware
	Ex : vlc, windows xp - firmware

IDENTIFYING PURPOSE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PROCESSOR

Function - Converting to 0s and 1s

PROCESSOR EVOLUTION

Transistors(transfer resistance) and semi conductors - switch electronic signals and electrical power. Takes tiny electric current at one end and produces much bigger electric current.
Dual Inline Package (DIP) - two parallel rows of electrical connecting pins.
Single Edge Contact Catridge (SECC) - this is where a processor with north bridge and south bridge was introduced
Single Edge Processor Package (SEPP) - same as SECC but with a protective covering.
Pin Grid Array (PGA)
Staggered Pin Grid Array (SPGA) - checkboard pattern. More no of pins. So speed is high.

ERROR CHECKING IN RAM

PARITY RAM

NAME        BITS        NO OF 1’S        PARITY BIT        RESULT
A    010101    Odd            1            010101 | 1
B    011011    Even           0            011011 | 0
C    010110    Odd            1            010110 | 1

This concept is called “False Positive”

NON PARITY RAM

NAME        BITS        NO OF 1’S        RESULT
A    010101    3            010101 | 3
B    011011    4            011011 | 4
C    111110    3            010110 | 5

This is called “Checksum”

RAM

	Random Access Memory
	Temporary memory
	WE have two types of RAM - Static RAM and Dynamic RAM

Static RAM

	It is also called as asynchronous RAM
	Non volatile 
	ZBT
	SRAM
	In static RAM, the data will always be permanent.
	Because it will not obey the processor and there is no refresh signal going to static ram from processor
	Its speed depends on itself

DYnamic RAM
	Synchronous DRAM
	DDR1
	DDR2
	DDR3
	DDR4
	DRD

	In dynamic RAM, the data is lost
	Because it always obeys the processor. SO whenver the signal from processor to Dynamic RAM stops, there is a data loss.
	The speed depends on the processor.

SDRAM - SIngle Data Rate RAM / Synchronous DRAM
DDR - Double Data Rate RAM
DRD - Direct Rambus Dynamic
ZBT - Zero Bus Turnaround (remove all the dead bus cycles from the static RAM)

SPEED IN RAM

Type        Data Rate    *No of Bits Transferred    *Clock Rate    = Speed in MBPS
SDRAM    	1        *    8*100                    = 800 mbps
DDR1        2        *    8*100                    =1600 mbps
DDR2        4        *    8*100                    =3200 mbps
DDR3        8        
DDR4

Parallel signal - for shorter distance communication
Serial signal  - for longer distance communication

PARALLEL PORT
	Used for connecting printers to your computers.
	Unidirectional Parallel Port - there is only communication from computer to printer.
	Bidirectional Parallel Port - there is communication between both the computer and printer

SERIAL PORT
